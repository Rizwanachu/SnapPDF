You are a senior SaaS product designer, conversion-focused UX writer, and full-stack deployment expert.

I am building a Flask-based Online PDF Tools web application similar to iLovePDF with features like merge, split, compress, OCR, convert (Word/Excel), watermark, protect/unlock, rotate, and extract images.

The app already works technically. Your task is to refine positioning, increase conversions, add trust signals, and prepare it for production deployment — WITHOUT changing the core tech stack or adding paid services.

–––––––––––––––––
GOALS
–––––––––––––––––
1) Refine homepage positioning so users instantly understand:
   - What the app does
   - Who it’s for
   - Why they should trust it
   - Why it’s better/simpler than alternatives

2) Improve free → premium conversion naturally (no dark patterns)

3) Add viral and trust signals using ONLY UI, copy, and logic (no new backend services)

4) Prepare the app for clean deployment on Vercel or Netlify

DELIVERABLES
–––––––––––––––––

A) HOMEPAGE POSITIONING
- Write a strong hero section:
  - Headline (clear, benefit-driven)
  - Subheadline (who it’s for + speed/privacy)
  - Primary CTA (free-first)
  - Secondary CTA (premium hint, not pushy)
- Feature section copy rewritten to sound simple, human, and outcome-focused
- One short “Why this tool exists” paragraph for trust

B) FREE → PREMIUM CONVERSION STRATEGY
- Define exactly:
  - What free users get (current limits respected)
  - What premium unlocks (speed, bulk, no limits, priority)
- Suggest where to place:
  - Upgrade nudges (after job completion, file limit reached, queue wait)
  - Soft copy for upgrade buttons (non-salesy)
- Write:
  - Pricing page headline + description
  - One persuasive but honest premium value paragraph

C) VIRAL + TRUST SIGNALS (NO TECH CHANGES)
- Add UI copy ideas such as:
  - “X PDFs processed today”
  - “Saved Y MB of storage this week”
  - “Used by students, freelancers, and teams”
- Add micro-copy for:
  - Privacy reassurance (files deleted, not stored)
  - Security reassurance
- Suggest 3 shareable moments:
  - After compression
  - After conversion
  - After merge
- Provide exact example share text users can copy

D) DEPLOYMENT PREP (VERCEL / NETLIFY)
- Explain:
  - Whether this app should be deployed on Vercel or Netlify and why
  - Required changes (if any) for Flask compatibility
  - Environment variable handling
  - File upload considerations
- Give a clean deployment checklist:
  - Build settings
  - Runtime
  - Routing
  - Production safety tips

CONSTRAINTS
–––––––––––––––––
- Do NOT suggest paid third-party services
- Do NOT rewrite backend logic
- Do NOT add new features
- Focus on copy, UX, positioning, and deployment clarity
- Output should be structured, practical, and ready to implement

Respond with clear sections, bullet points, and ready-to-use copy.
