You are a senior SaaS product strategist, conversion-focused UX writer, and monetization expert.

I am building a Flask-based Online PDF Tools web app called SnapPDF with features like merge, split, compress, OCR, convert to Word/Excel, watermark, protect/unlock, rotate pages, extract images, and background job processing.

The app already works. Your task is to redesign the premium experience so users WANT to upgrade immediately, without using dark patterns or breaking trust.

–––––––––––––––––
PRIMARY GOAL
–––––––––––––––––
Maximize free → premium conversion by:
- Framing premium as relief, speed, and certainty
- Locking the RIGHT features (not the core wow moment)
- Adding emotional upgrade triggers at the perfect moments

–––––––––––––––––
DELIVERABLES
–––––––––––––––––

A) PREMIUM POSITIONING
- Rename “Premium” to something more desirable (example: SnapPDF Pro / Unlimited Mode / No Limits Pass)
- Write:
  - One-sentence premium value proposition
  - 3 short benefit bullets focused on removing friction (not features)

B) FEATURE LOCKING STRATEGY (CRITICAL)
- Decide which features should be:
  - Always free (first win)
  - Soft-limited (nudged)
  - Hard-locked (premium only)
- Suggest AT LEAST:
  - 2 existing features to partially lock (limits, quality, speed)
  - 2 new lightweight features that can be added easily and locked behind premium
- For each locked feature, explain:
  - Why it increases conversion
  - When the upgrade prompt should appear

C) PERFECT UPGRADE TRIGGERS
- Design upgrade prompts for:
  - File size limit hit
  - Batch processing attempt
  - Queue wait / slow processing
  - High-quality compression selection
  - OCR language selection
- Provide exact copy for each modal (friendly, human, non-pushy)

D) PRICING PSYCHOLOGY
- Improve presentation of $4.99/month using: 
  - Daily cost framing
  - Risk reversal copy
  - Trust microcopy
- Write:
  - Pricing page headline
  - One emotional paragraph that sells premium without sounding salesy

E) VIRAL + TRUST SIGNALS (NO TECH CHANGES)
- Add:
  - Usage-based trust messages
  - Privacy reassurance copy
  - Security reassurance copy
- Suggest 3 shareable moments after processing
- Provide exact share text examples users can copy

F) UX RULES (DO NOT BREAK)
- Define what must NEVER be locked
- Define what can be limited without hurting trust
- Define the moment when premium should be suggested and when it should not

- Do NOT remove free value
- Do NOT require forced login before first success
- Do NOT add paid third-party services
- Focus on copy, UX, psychology, and smart feature gating
- Output must be practical and implementation-ready
